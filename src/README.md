# Introduction

If you think about it, internet access is often provided to you through Ethernet (cable), WiFi, or Cellular Network. In this course, we will take a different approach, using accoustic signals instead of electric signals to communicate. We will also build a 'network' from scratch, down from the physical layer to the application layer. We call this network `athernet`.

## Overview
The project is divided into 4 parts.
- Project 0 conists of 2 checkpoints to ensure that you have setup your tools correctly. It is also a good time for you to assess whether this course is a good fit for you.
- Project 1 requires you to implement a simple acoustic link. You will transmit your fit via sound, or accoustically. Though 100% percent reliability is not required.
- Project 2 focuses on reliable transmission. You improve upon your unreliable physical link, using knowledge taught from class.

## Optional Checkpoints
Projects will also contain optional checkpoints, which are labeled with `*`. Mandatory checkpoints are often prerequisites for later projects, meaning you won't be able to proceed working on the next project without implementing them correctly. Optional checkpoints, while not a strict dependency, helps making you implementation more robust and performant. Optional checkpoints are not necessarily harder than mandatory ones, but they do often require extra research aside from the lecture. Credits are given generously for optional checkpoints. So it is highly recommended that you at least attempt them. You might even skip the final exam and still receive full credit if you implement all of them!

## Instructions
- This project is to be completed by each group individually.
- Submit your code through Blackboard.
- Submission is performed by one of the group members.
- Each group needs to submit the code once and only once. Immediately after TAs' checking.
- Both members should be present on the day checking.
