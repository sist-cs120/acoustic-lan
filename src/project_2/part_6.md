## Part 6. (Optional + 2 points) Collision Detection

Network performance is determined by many factors. High throughput physical layer does not necessarily indicate high network performance. To further increase the efficiency of CSMA protocol, PHY.Tx thread can be aborted if PHY.Rx thread indicates high power, i.e., CSMA/CD.

Checkpoints:

Check settings are the same as Part3.

The throughput of NODE1 should be higher when collision detection is enabled.
