## Part 1. (4 points) From Wireless to Wire

The main purpose of moving from wireless link to wired link is to reduce the heterogeneity and complexity in acoustic hardware, e.g., ringing effect from mechanical vibration, distortions from nonlinear amplifiers, uneven response, echos, etc. The method to establish a wired link between two nodes is connecting their 3.5mm analog audio interfaces, e.g., connecting the MIC port to the Speaker port (See the red line in Figure 2). Note that the signal flowing between the two ports is no longer an acoustic signal. It is an electric wave generated by the DAC.

The electric signal output from the Speaker port is normally used to stimulate the mechanical hardware, e.g., the speaker, to generate sound. On the other hand, the ADC in the MIC port will transform any the input electric signal into digital samples, no matter the signal is generated by a DAC from other device (red) or a microphone (black). Generally speaking, through the wired connection between DAC and ADC, the received signal contains much fewer distortions than the signal in Project1. Your code of Project1 should work seamlessly and very likely much better in the wired situation.

Figure 2 Wire Connection

In this part, your task is to set up the wired link between two nodes. This task is almost the same as Project1.Part3, but we expect higher performance (>5kbps).

Checkpoints:

The group provides two devices: NODE1 and NODE2, connected by audio cables.

CK(4 points). TAs provide a binary file 'INPUT.bin' which contains 6250 Bytes. NODE1 sends bits according to this file. NODE2 stores the received bytes into a binary file 'OUTPUT.bin'.

The transmission must be finished within 20 seconds.

| Transmission Time | Points |
| --- | --- |
| [0, 10s] | 100% |
| (10s, 15s] | 80% |
| (15s, 20s] | 50% |
| >20s | 0% |

TAs compare the difference between INPUT.bin and OUTPUT.bin:

| Accuracy | Points |
| --- | --- |
| <80% | \*0% |
| 80% to 99% | \*80% |
| >99% | \*100% |

Tips:

a. You are recommended to unplug the chargers/power adapters of your devices when doing wired experiments. The reason is that different AC-to-DC adapters (especially the ones without ground plugin) may have different voltages of their 'ground', so do the 'ground' of the charging devices. When interconnecting two devices with wires, they may have different 'ground'. In some cases, the problem just results in biased DC levels in the received signal from connected devices. Sometimes it may bring harmful damages. If you have to connect two devices with different 'ground' (e.g., a charging laptop and a desktop), you should be very careful.

b. The throughput can be increased by modifying your physical layer (PHY) of project 1, e.g., decrease the time for each symbol. You can also develop a new PHY suitable for the wired situation.

c. You can design shorter preamble to reduce the header overhead.

d. You can use the audio card of your own devices. Sometime they have better performance (in terms of the quality of the generated/received signal) than the offered ones.

e. In some laptops and smartphones, the MIC in and speaker ports are combined into a single port, you may need an adapter to split them.

f. In project 1, we use carrier wave to convey information over the air wirelessly. In project 2, it is not necessary to so. You can directly use line code and transmit the baseband signal in the wire, which might be more efficient.
