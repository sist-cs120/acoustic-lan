# Project 0 Setup

Project 0 mainly serves as a prerequisite self-assessment. It is due before the course add/drop deadline, so you can decide for yourself whether this course is a good fit for you.

## Prequisite Self-Check
- Do you prefer conceptual contents or hands-on coding experience?

  Unlike previous offerings of Computer Network, this course is project-oriented. The project accounts for a considerable amount of the total credit. And you'll have to write (or rewrite) a lot of code throughout the semester. If you goal is just to understand computer network protocols conceptually without going into the nitty-gritties, and still get a good grade, then please consult the instructor for further advice.

- Do you feel comfortable learning how to use libraries on your own?

  Project specification does not mandate the use of any programming language or library. However, this also means that you are your own to figure out which language or library to use. We can offer advice on which language or library suites the project based on past experience, but can't help with individual implementation issues.

- Do you feel comfortable programming multithreaded programs?

  You'll need to send packets and receive packets at the same time, and thus at least 2 threads are needed. Multithreaded code can be very difficult to code and debug due to concurrent data structures access.

- Are you ok with engineering tasks, e.g. parameter tuning?

  Unlike other autograded courses where testcases are nicely-formatted and well-defined, this course does not have any testcases. Instead, you'll have to interact with the real world, which the author personally thinks is cooler and exciting. On the flipside, you might have to tune your code accordingly to the hardware. Code that works on one computer may not work on another computer. Transimission reliability is also dependent on the environment (noise).

## Submission
- Report your group member's name, student id, and email to the TA on the day of checking.
- Submit a writeup.
- Submit your code through Blackboard.
