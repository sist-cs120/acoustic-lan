## Form a Pair
Form a group with 2 members. Although working alone on the project is allowed, it is highly recommended that you find a partner. The projects are very intensive, and working in pair can alleviate your burden. Later projects require 2 ~ 3 computers. We might have to buy extra equipments (sound card, cable, etc.) if there are too many students working a lone.
