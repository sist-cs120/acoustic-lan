## Understanding Your Tools

In this part, your task is to use the chosen audio interface to correctly control your sound card's ADC and DAC to play digital samples through speaker and to record analog sound signals from microphone. Playing and recoding should be able to work simultaneously, as the transmitter and the receiver of a network card normally works simultaneously. You can use two independent threads to play and record sound simultaneously.

Knowing how to play and recode sound does not help in generating a correct sound signal. The later task is more about calculation and matching sampling rate. Suppose the sound you want to generate is f(t) and the DAC uses sample rate fs. Filling digital samples f(0), f(1/fs), f(2/fs), â€¦, f(n/fs) into the DAC buffer will generate correct sound signal f(t) for the speaker. In this procedure, f(t) is sampled into discrete samples at rate fs.

### Devices
- NODE1: computer for playing and recording sound

### Checkpoints:

1. NODE1 is able to play signal: f(t) = sin (2pi/1000\*t) + sin (2pi/10000\*t). TAs use spectrum analyzer to check the frequencies of the sound signal.
2. NODE1 record the voice from TA (10 seconds) and then play the recorded signals. (1 point)
3. NODE1 play a predefined sound and record the played sound at the same time. TA may say something during the recording. After 10 seconds, stop playing and recording. Then play the recorded sound for verification.

```sh
athernet --node 1 --play 1000,10000
athernet --node 1 --record 10
athernet --node 1 --play <frequency> --record 10
```

### Tips
- Be careful about stereo settings. We only need one track.
- Be careful about the sampling rate of the ADC and DAC, match them unless you know what you are doing.
- You can record the sound into a file, and then use tools like Matlab/NumPy to load, plot and replay the sound in the file. It is a useful debugging technique that you will frequently use in this and future projects.
- Window and Linux have very different architecture in handling sound [7]. You are recommended to use 44.1kHz sample rate in Linux, including Android.
- DAC's sample rates are fixed values such as 8kHz, 16kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, etc. These values are internally determined by the hardware. Choose fs from the supported rates as your desired sample rate, because any sample rates other than the supported ones are to be converted by the operating system or the media player, which could bring unexpected problems.
- Useful phone Apps for debugging: ATG Lite (generating pure tone), SpectrumView (viewing sound wave and spectrum)
- Different operating systems have different architectures for media I/O, but their usages are quite similar. In order to convey bits through acoustic signals, you must be able to correctly send and receive through the media interface.
- For playing with sound (e.g. transmitting sound samples through the speakers and sampling sound through the microphone) via your computers, you can start by referring to the Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO) protocol [6]. ASIO is supported by most sound card drivers. Compared with the default/or common system audio interfaces, such as WindowsAudio or DirectSound, ASIO has significant improvement on the latency. The latency measures the elapse of time when a sample is 'written' into the buffer of the sound interface and the time when the audio of that sample is actually played by the audio hardware, which matters a lot in our next project. Not surprisingly, the latency is related to the buffer size of the sound interface. But small buffer size in a loaded system might result in a discontinuous sound wave or a 'buzz' sound. ASIO reduces the latency at its best while maintaining sound quality. ASIO has several driver implementations. ASIO4ALL [10] working in Windows is verified by me. For programming in JAVA, you can choose a JAVA wrapper [11] to access the ASIO driver. For programming in other languages, you can either call the ASIO native APIs directly or find other wrappers yourself. For Linux and MAC OS user, you can either try WineASIO or other low latency audio interfaces, but there is no guarantee on that (I haven't tried them). Here is a utility to test the latency of the chosen sound interface [12]. The latency should be within 20 ms or better (15 ms) in order to finish Project 2.
