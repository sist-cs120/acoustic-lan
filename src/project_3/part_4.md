## Part 4 Ping from External Network*

Part 3 enables ICMP echo from the network behind NAT to the Internet. Normally, ICMP echo is not able to go through a NAT gateway to the internal network from the external network. However, the payload of the ICMP packets can be leveraged to piggyback information for NAT to indicate the internal destination [5]. Suppose the NAT gateway uses static mapping, i.e., <NODE1\_IP, NODE1\_port#, NODE2\_IP, NODE2\_port#> is static. If <NODE2IP, NODE2port#> is known to the public, e.g., NODE3. NODE3 can modify the ICMP Echo Request payload through ping â€“p option. Define the special ICMP payload and modify the NAT gateway to support ping from the external network.

### Device
- NODE1: receives and replies ICMP packets
- NODE2: NAT
- NODE3: ping NODE2\_IP -p XXXX
TAs provide NODE3

### Tips
- You can try iptables + string match to redirect ICMP packets to some listening port for NAT processing.

### Checkpoint


The IP of the Athernet interface of NODE1 is 192.168.1.2, the default gateway is 192.168.1.1
The IP of the Athernet interface of NODE2 is 192.168.1.1

X is specified by the group.

NODE3 should be able to receive the ping reply from NODE1.
