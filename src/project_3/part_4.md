## Ping from External Network*

Part 3 enables ICMP echo from the network behind NAT to the Internet. Normally, ICMP echo is not able to go through a NAT gateway to the internal network from the external network. However, the payload of the ICMP packets can be leveraged to piggyback information for NAT to indicate the internal destination [5]. Suppose the NAT gateway uses static mapping, i.e., <NODE1\_IP, NODE1\_port#, NODE2\_IP, NODE2\_port#> is static. If <NODE2IP, NODE2port#> is known to the public, e.g., NODE3. NODE3 can modify the ICMP Echo Request payload through ping â€“p option. Define the special ICMP payload and modify the NAT gateway to support ping from the external network.

### Tips
- You can try iptables + string match to redirect ICMP packets to some listening port for NAT processing.

### Device
- NODE1: Replier, Athernet interface IP: 192.168.1.2
- NODE2: Gateway, Athernet interface IP: 192.168.1.1
- NODE3: Sender, provided by TA

### Checkpoint
- Report your ICMP payload format and content to TA.
- Report your NAT table to TA.
- Initiate NODE2 to ready Network Address Translation.
- TA run `ping <NODE2IP> -p <payload>` on NODE3
    - Payload content is decided by the group.
- NODE2 performs NAT and forward the ICMP packet to NODE1 via the Athernet interface.
- NODE1 replies with ICMP Echo Reply to NODE1. (TA's computer)
- NODE2 performs NAT and forward the ICMP packet to NODE3 via the Wifi interface.
- NODE3 should successfully receive the ICMP Echo Reply and indicate no packet loss or timeout.
