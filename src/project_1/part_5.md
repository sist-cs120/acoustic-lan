## Error Correction Code

Current acoustic link is susceptible to noise. You can add redundancy in your bits to resist errors caused by noise. This procedure is called coding. There are many coding schemes. Refer to [5] for more information (Convolutional code and Fountain code are suggested ones in this project).

### Checkpoints:
- Check routine is similar to [Part 3](/project_1/part_3.md).
- File size remains 1000 bytes.
- Timing requirement is relaxed to 20 seconds.
- **Points are given only if full accuracy is achieved.**
