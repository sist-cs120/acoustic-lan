The goal of this project is to enrich Athernet Nodes's applications by providing the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service. We are going to implement an FTP client for Athernet Node. After this project, Athernet Node is able to connect to public FTP servers.

Figure 1 Project4 Overview

FTP is a protocol targeting file transfer between clients and servers. We have finished many tasks transferring small files in previous projects. FTP is different from these simple file transfer examples in that it integrates the network transmission and the local file system. Through FTP, remote file transfer is platform-independent and easy to use.
