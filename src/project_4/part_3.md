# Part 3 Every End is a New Beginning

Return what you borrowed to TAs after finishing checking Project4. Ensure your borrowed accessories are in good condition, as they will be reused in future semesters. TAs will provide a handy plastic bag for each group to pack up the returned accessories. The last step is to sign off at the record card in the plastic bag.

(Tasks with 'Optional' tag are optional tasks. The instructor is responsible for checking and grading the optional tasks. Contact the instructor to check any optional parts (of this or previous projects) on/before Jan. 10.)
